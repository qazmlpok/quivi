= Installing Quivi =

These instructions apply only if you're installing from source.

== Required libraries ==

- Python 3.6 or later
- wxPython 4.1.1 or more recent (http://wxpython.org/)
  - On Windows, just use pip: pip install -U wxPython
  - On Ubuntu, the official release is much older. Check
    http://wiki.wxpython.org/InstallingOnUbuntuOrDebian
    to find how to install the most recent version.
  - Other distributions: check the wxPython page.
- FreeImage (http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/)
  - On Windows, download the most recent binary distribution and copy
    FreeImage.dll into the quivi folder.
  - On Linux, the 'libfreeimage.so.3' library is loaded. The library
    available on your repository will probably do.
- UnRAR (http://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm)
  - The python library rarfile is used, which relies on the UnRar tool
    existing in the PATH. See:
    https://rarfile.readthedocs.io/faq.html#how-can-i-get-it-work-on-windows


== Installing ==

=== Linux ===

Install the required libraries. Extract the source.
Now you have two options:
- Change to the extracted directory and do a "python setup.py install".
  You can now open Quivi by typing "quivi" in a terminal,
  or with the shortcut in your desktop manager menu.
  The downside is that you can't easily uninstall the application.
- Run the application from the extracted directory. Just change
  to it, do a "chmod +x quivi.pyw" and type "./quivi.pyw" (you may rename
  it to "quivi")
  
=== Windows ===

Is much easier to use the binary versions, but if you want to run from
the source, you probably know what you're doing and just do something among
the lines of the Linux steps.

The binary package can be built using PyInstaller, using the command:
set PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1 && pyinstaller quivi.spec --noconsole --noconfirm
